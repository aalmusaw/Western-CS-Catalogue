# Western-CS-Catalogue

This website was built on a machine with an APACHE server that runs a MySQL DBMS. The website application is part of a course project to practice developing a CRUD application.

A user can view a list of computer science courses and is allowed to delete or add more courses. In addition, they can establish a course equivalency between a Western course and
another course offered by a different university. More on the website's features in a video.

All the code used was developed by hand and no WYSISWYG tools were used.
This is my first web app and I am sure there is a lot to improve!
